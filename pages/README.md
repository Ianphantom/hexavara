Use this folder to save all the pages name. So all the pages component will be save in this folder. For each of the page, please create a folder for the corresponding pages.

For each component that only used within the specific pages, create the component inside the pages folder

Naming Convention (for Developer)

- Use small case with PascalCase style for file name. Please add 'PagesNames.component' text to the file name. For Example, IndexAboutUsPages.Component.jsx
